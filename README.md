### What is the Food Truck Trackr App?
Instagram, but made specifically for logging and tracking your outdoor and mountainous excursions!

* Pitch:
  * Every true "foodie" worth their salt knows that some of the best food in any city can be found on food trucks - but knowing when and where those trucks will be can be next to impossible, and discovering new ones often relies on word-of-mouth that is long on tales of delicious, but short on actual details.
